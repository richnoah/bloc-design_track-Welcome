# bloc-design_track-Welcome
## This is my first submission to the program

The attributes that I feel I will be good include:
* I am a habitual learner and a self-starter
* I always like challenges as this is the way I grow and improve
* I am extremely focused and disciplined.  I am analytical and like to follow processes.
* If my research and findings can help another I feel it is necessary to share.  No need to have everyone dedicating their time to retrieving the same information.
* Definitely take time to celebrate accomplishments, both mine and others

I am looking forward to meeting you all and learning as I go to join this fascinating trade.
